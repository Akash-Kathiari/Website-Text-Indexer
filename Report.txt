Report: Part A
***How the indexing function was developed***: The indexing was developed by: 
1) importing BeautifulSoup, nltk, re, os, json.
2) set a Dictionary for the inverted list.
3) created a counter and set it to 0.
4) Loop and clean every HTML file in the folder to do this i had to Read local files as input, Remove html tags, Extract page text, Tokenize the words in the file.
5) Set a document counter.
6) set a dictionary within the loop as a holding place
7) loop through ever single token in the file
8) is the token in the dictionary? if No then create an entry with the token as the key. if yes then move out of loop.
9) add the document counter to the value of the token in the dictionary
10)add 1 to the document counter
11) end the token loop
12) end the document loop

Report: Part B)
***number of documents indexed: 511 documents indexed***
***total number of unique terms: 85,327 unique terms***

An issues i had was writing and formating the information to a text file properly, so as a last effort i had to import a library to print the dictionary for both 'index.txt' and 'unique-terms.txt'
